# 🧠 Quant Stock Screener & Backtest Pipeline

A systematic approach to designing, testing, and simulating stock selection strategies — built for real-world alpha generation and Robinhood-readiness.

## 📌 Phase 1: Strategy Planning

**Goal**: Define the type of strategy you're building. Let the *strategy type* dictate what metrics you’ll need and how the backtest logic will behave.

### Strategy Types:
- **Momentum**: Buy what’s going up.
- **Value**: Buy what’s cheap.
- **Mean Reversion**: Buy what’s oversold.
- **Factor Combo**: Blend of multiple signals.
- **ML/AI**: Predictive models (advanced phase).

## 📊 Phase 2: Data and Setup

**Goal**: Collect and clean data, define the tradable universe, and set up the environment.

### Components:
- Start with **S&P 500** or **NASDAQ-100** for simplicity.
- Use APIs like `yfinance`, Alpha Vantage, or Polygon for OHLCV data.
- Save raw data locally using `pandas`, CSV, or SQLite.
- Install tools: `pandas`, `yfinance`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `QuantStats`, `bt`, etc.

## 🧮 Phase 3: Scoring and Filtering

**Goal**: Generate ranks or scores for each stock based on the strategy.

### Examples:
- Momentum: 6-month return or RSI-based score.
- Value: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA ratios.
- Quality: ROE, profit margin, earnings stability.
- Composite Score: Weighted average of multiple factors.

### Output:
- Top N stocks based on ranking
- Sector-neutral or sector-tilted portfolios (optional)

## 🔁 Phase 4: Backtest Engine

**Goal**: Simulate trades over historical data to test portfolio performance.

### Considerations:
- Rebalance frequency: monthly, weekly, quarterly
- Position sizing: equal-weight or volatility-weighted
- Trade costs/slippage: include optional assumptions
- Metrics to calculate: return, alpha, Sharpe, drawdown

---

## 📈 Phase 5: Evaluation & Visualization

**Goal**: Visualize and evaluate strategy performance in comparison to a benchmark.

### Metrics:
- Cumulative Return
- Benchmark Comparison (e.g., SPY)
- Alpha, Beta
- Sharpe Ratio
- Max Drawdown
- Monthly Return Heatmaps
- Rolling Metrics (Sharpe, Beta, etc.)

Tools: `matplotlib`, `QuantStats`, `plotly`, or `streamlit` (if building a dashboard)

---

## 🚀 Phase 6: Paper Portfolio Mode

**Goal**: Track your strategy live, simulating Robinhood trades without using real money.

### Features:
- Export buy/sell signals to CSV
- Simulated account balance and holdings
- Optional: create a web dashboard with Streamlit or Flask
- Optional future phase: integrate with Robinhood API (if accessible)
