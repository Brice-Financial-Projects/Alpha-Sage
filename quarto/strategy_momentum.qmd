# 🧠 Strategy Overview

This strategy aims to identify **commodity ETFs** exhibiting sustained upward momentum, using a combination of **trend confirmation** and **relative strength**.

The objective is to capture medium-term trends in liquid commodity-based ETFs using **technically-driven signals**, with no reliance on fundamentals.

# 📊 Signal Construction

The strategy uses a **two-stage filter**:

### 1. **Trend Filter (SMA Confirmation)**
Only include ETFs where the current price is **above the 100-day simple moving average** (SMA). This ensures we are only considering assets in a confirmed uptrend.

$$
\text{Trend Filter: } \frac{P_{t}}{SMA_{100}} > 1.0
$$

### 2. **Relative Strength Ranking**
Among ETFs passing the trend filter, we calculate **3-month total return** and rank them:

$$
\text{Momentum Score: } \frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 63}} - 1
$$

Where:
- \( P_t \) = current closing price
- \( P_{t - 63} \) = closing price 3 months ago (approx. 63 trading days)

---

# 🔎 Selection Process

1. **Apply Trend Filter**: Drop any ETFs with price below their 100-day SMA.
2. **Rank Remaining ETFs**: By 3-month return (descending).
3. **Select Top N**: Typically the top 3 ETFs are chosen for equal-weighted allocation.

---

# 🔁 Rebalancing Logic

- **Frequency**: Monthly (every 21 trading days)
- **Positioning**: Equal weight across selected ETFs
- **No leverage**, no shorting
- **Transaction cost**: Flat $0.005/share (optional)

---

# 📉 Risk Management

- Max number of positions: 3
- Exit ETF if it drops below 100-day SMA during holding period
- Optional: Use trailing stop (e.g., -10%) in future versions

---

# 🧪 Next Steps

- Implement scoring logic in `scoring.py`
- Add backtest simulation in `backtest_engine.py`
- Visualize equity curves and rolling Sharpe using `visualization.py`
- Document test cases in `tests/test_scoring.py`

---

# 📌 Notes

This strategy is inspired by classic CTA and trend-following systems. While simple in design, its performance can be robust across asset classes, especially in macro-driven environments where commodity momentum often dominates.

Future enhancements may include:
- Volatility-adjusted position sizing
- Rolling Z-score filters
- Incorporation of volume or sentiment data
